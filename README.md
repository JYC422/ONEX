I wanted to create a side-scrolling shooter game and incorporate new features in addition to popular core features. In addition to the action aspect of the genre, I planned to add more rpg elements to give the game more longetivity and depth. Before even trying to tackle the creation of a game, I looked into gaming frameworks and ended up working with Phaser.
